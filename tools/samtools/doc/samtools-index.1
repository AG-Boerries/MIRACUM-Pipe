.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools index
.RB [ -bc ]
.RB [ -m
.IR INT ]
.IR aln.bam | aln.cram
.RI [ out.index ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Index a coordinate-sorted BAM or CRAM file for fast random access.
(Note that this does not work with SAM files even if they are bgzip
compressed \(em to index such files, use tabix(1) instead.)

This index is needed when
.I region
arguments are used to limit
.B samtools view
and similar commands to particular regions of interest.

If an output filename is given, the index file will be written to
.IR out.index .
Otherwise, for a CRAM file
.IR aln.cram ,
index file
.IB aln.cram .crai
will be created; for a BAM file
.IR aln.bam ,
either
.IB aln.bam .bai
or
.IB aln.bam .csi
will be created, depending on the index format selected.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -b
Create a BAI index.
This is currently the default when no format options are used.
.TP
.B -c
Create a CSI index.
By default, the minimum interval size for the index is 2^14, which is the same
as the fixed value used by the BAI format.
.TP
.BI "-m " INT
Create a CSI index, with a minimum interval size of 2^INT.
