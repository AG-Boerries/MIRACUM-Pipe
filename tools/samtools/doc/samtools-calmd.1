.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
samtools calmd
.RB [ -Eeubr ]
.RB [ -C
.IR capQcoef "] " aln.bam " " ref.fasta

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Generate the MD tag. If the MD tag is already present, this command will
give a warning if the MD tag generated is different from the existing
tag. Output SAM by default.

Calmd can also read and write CRAM files although in most cases it is
pointless as CRAM recalculates MD and NM tags on the fly.  The one
exception to this case is where both input and output CRAM files
have been / are being created with the \fIno_ref\fR option.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B -A
When used jointly with
.B -r
this option overwrites the original base quality.
.TP 8
.B -e
Convert a the read base to = if it is identical to the aligned reference
base. Indel caller does not support the = bases at the moment.
.TP
.B -u
Output uncompressed BAM
.TP
.B -b
Output compressed BAM
.TP
.BI -C \ INT
Coefficient to cap mapping quality of poorly mapped reads. See the
.B mpileup
command for details. [0]
.TP
.B -r
Compute the BQ tag (without -A) or cap base quality by BAQ (with -A).
.TP
.B -E
Extended BAQ calculation. This option trades specificity for sensitivity, though the
effect is minor.

.SH EXAMPLES
.IP o 2
Dump BAQ applied alignment for other SNP callers:
.EX 2
samtools calmd -bAr aln.bam > aln.baq.bam
.EE
It adds and corrects the
.B NM
and
.B MD
tags at the same time. The
.B calmd
command also comes with the
.B -C
option, the same as the one in
.BR mpileup .
Apply if it helps.
